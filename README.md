This repository contains my mini projects with which I was learning MERN technlogies and frameworks. It is mainly dedicaded to frontend with React and Redux, 
as I have not uploaded my Node&Express&Mongo learning projects to Github. This projects are heavily inspired by Dave Gray's tutorials from Youtube, 
containing only slight changes, such as React v6 router version for the blog-app instead of the v5.
